    <p> Deers are the coolest creatures because they are calm and friendly, <br>
    Fawns can stand and walk just <strong>20 minutes</strong> after being born. <br>
    Deers can run as fast as <strong>30-40</strong> miles per hour and male deers grow antlers every year and shed them. <br>
  In <em>Nara-Deer-Park-Japan</em>, you can feed and pet deers aswell as meet other animals! </p>
